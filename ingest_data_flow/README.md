# Diagram steps

1. Extract the data from the source system using an Azure Data Factory pipeline, configured with a source dataset to read the raw data from the source system.

1. Validate the extracted data using custom Python scripts or built-in validation processors in Data Factory, such as the Validate Data Flow activity or the Azure Data Factory Data Flow expression builder.

1. Transform the validated data using the Data Flow activity in Azure Data Factory, which provides a visual interface to build data transformations using a drag-and-drop interface. This may include additional data transformations, de-identification, or data enrichment.

1. Load the transformed data into your target data store or analytics platform using the appropriate sink connector in Azure Data Factory, such as the Azure Synapse Analytics connector or the Azure SQL Database connector.

1. Configure the appropriate data loading settings in the sink connector, such as the column mapping, file format, and batch size. You can also configure performance optimization settings, such as parallelism and partitioning, to optimize the data loading process.

1. Schedule the Azure Data Factory pipeline to run at regular intervals to keep the target data store or analytics platform up-to-date with the latest data from the source system.

1. Monitor the ETL process for any errors or performance issues using Azure Data Factory's built-in monitoring and logging features, such as the Azure Data Factory Metrics and Activity Runs pages.
